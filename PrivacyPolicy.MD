PostMaster does not collect, store, share, sell, or use any of your data stored in this app. All your information is stored on your device and does not, and never will, leave your device. \n\nThe ‘Track’ feature inside PostMaster only inputs your generated tracking link into the website for your provider. This is routed through Safari, Apple’s built-in and extremely secure Web Browser. No external companies, such as Google, never see these tracking numbers, generated links, or information on your parcels. The provider your package is with, such as Royal Mail, will only see your tracking number in order to display the current status of your package.\n\nAdditionally, PostMaster cannot view the contents, details, or information of your deliveries, and cannot see any information regarding your package. It can only be viewed by you, an no one else.\n\nWhen navigating to the carrier/provider’s website, you are consenting to their privacy policy. PostMaster is not responsible for their privacy policy and/or what they do with your tracking numbers/information.\n\nProtecting your privacy is an integral part to the design of PostMaster. In a world where your privacy is becoming less and less protected, PostMaster is designed to keep your information safe.
